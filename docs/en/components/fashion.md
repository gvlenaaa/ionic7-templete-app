# Tutorial for the "Fashion" Component

This component makes it easy to display products in an online store. It is suitable for pages featuring clothing, shoes, accessories, or other product categories. The component shows the product image, name, price, and a brief description, and allows the user to learn more about each item.

Here’s how a product typically appears on the page:  
- Product name — for example, “T-shirt” or “Jeans”  
- Price — cost in rubles  
- Description — a few words about the product, its features, or materials  
- “More details” button — when clicked, the user can go to a page with full product information  
- Each product is displayed in a separate block, making the page neat and easy to browse.

## TO DO

- Enable product sorting by price or name  
- Add filters for size, color, or material  
- Include an “Add to Cart” button  
- Show discounts or promotions
